          Rain, he wanted it comfortable
          I wanted that pain
          He wanted a bride
          I was making my own name
          Chasing that fame
          He stayed the same
          All of me changed like midnight
          My town was a wasteland
          Full of cages, full of fences
          Pageant queens and big pretenders
          But for some, it was paradise
          My boy was a montage
          A slow-motion, love potion
          Jumping off things in the ocean
          I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
          He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
          He wanted it comfortable
          I wanted that pain
          He wanted a bride
          I was making my own name
          Chasing that fame
          He stayed the same
          All of me changed like midnight
          It came like a postcard
          Picture perfect, shiny family
          Holiday, peppermint candy
          But for him it's every day
          So I peered through a window
          A deep portal, time travel
          All the love we unravel
          And the life I gave away
          'Cause he was sunshine
          I was midnight rain
          He wanted it comfortable
          I wanted that pain
          He wanted a bride
          I was making my own name
          Chasing that fame
          He stayed the same
          All of me changed
          Like midnight
          Rain, he wanted it comfortable
          I wanted that pain
          He wanted a bride
          I was making my own name
          Chasing that fame
          He stayed the same
          All of me changed
          Like midnight
          I guess sometimes we all get
          Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
          And he never thinks of me
          Except when I'm on TV
          I guess sometimes we all get
          Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
          And I never think of him
          Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)
